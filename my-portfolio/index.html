                Hello, my name is Gerald Ofokansi, and i am an Email developer. <br/>
                I have been working as a Freelancer since 2021. I must confess, i had to transition into the tech industry because i have always been a creative.
                During my days in the University i was into music while studying for an Accounting degree. I do believe within the coming years, the evolution of technology will take over the world and make so many jobs obsolete, Accountants included.
                Like they say, "Curiosity kills the cat" and that has led me into joining the tech world. <br/>
                Okay, enough of me! Let's talk about how i can be of service to you. I specialize in creating landing pages and Email templates for individuals and small businesses from scratch, which brings about it's uniqueness. <br/>
                There is really no point settling for a generic and cheap alternative when my services are readily available. You are unique, and so should your brand. Besides, the price i charge is very pocket friendly, and i am certain 
                you will not break the bank.You need customers to land on your landing pages and make sure they sign up to your newsletters. This is where my services come into play because first impression matters, and i am here<br/>
                for your brand and business to make a good one. Seeing is believing, so you can take a look at my projects below. I am sure my work will convince you. Do shoot me an email by clicking on the button to the right, or <br/> 
                in the contact section of the page. Please, try not to spam me, thank you!</p></div>
